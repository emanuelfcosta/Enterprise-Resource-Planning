#  Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP
 Complete ERP System

This is a complete ERP system. It was originally written to be used in Brazil and therefore some fields like cnpj/cpf, IE and the states are for use in Brazil. I tried my best to adapt the system and source code to be understood by English speakers.

To use the system, first create a database and run the Database_ERP_GIT.sql file script. Go to the app/database/Sql.php folder and edit the HOSTNAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD and DBNAME fields.
